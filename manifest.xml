  <description brief="A asguard specific package that filters asguard body parts out of the laser scan">
  This package is needed to avoid the apearance of ghost obstacles in front 
  of the robot. The ghost obstacles are created by the robot scanning itself. 
  This package has a geometric model of the robot and filters out the scan 
  beams that hit the robot.
